# Creating Forms

### Introduction
Forms are used for pages such as Space Rental, Volunteering Sign Up, Contact Us, etc. This is a how-to guide that goes through the steps taken to create a form using the plugin [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/).

### Creating a form
When you are the WordPress admin dashboard, there should be a category on the left with the title Contact. When you hover your mouse over it, there should be three different options: Contact Forms, Add New, and Integration. Click on Add New. There should now be a default form in front of you with basic form fields created. Customize as you wish by creating a title, click on buttons to create the fields you desire, and going through the other tabs to meet your needs. Click Save when you're done.

After creating a form, hover over Contact again and this time click on Contact Forms. This will take you to a page that lists out all the forms you've created. When you find the name of the form you just created, you'll see there's a middle column named Shortcode. Copy the shortcode of your form. Next, hover your mouse over Pages on the left hand menu. Click on Add New to create a new page. In the body of the page, paste the shortcode in. This page will now have the form you just created. Customize the page to meet your needs.
