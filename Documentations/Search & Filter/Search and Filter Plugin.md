# Using the Search and Filter Plugin

### Introduction
This is a how-to guide that goes through the steps to upload documents onto WordPress through the Search and Filter plugin. It is important to note that there are multiple ways of achieving the same result. To do the following steps, log onto an admin account for the WordPress website.

### Using the plugin
Once you have the Search and Filter plugin activated, you can add the Search & Filter plugin onto a page with the following shortcode:
[searchandfilter fields="search"]

You can add other filters to the plugin on the page by adding them into the shortcode:
[searchandfilter fields="search, category, post_tag"]

More options and examples can be seen on http://docs.designsandcode.com/search-filter/
You can see what kinds of categories and tags your site has by going to the Search and Filter tab on your WordPress dashboard (SearchFilterSS01.png, SearchFilterSS02.png)
