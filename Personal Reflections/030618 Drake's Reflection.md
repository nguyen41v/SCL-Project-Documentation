## 3/6/18 Drake's Personal Reflection

#### How did the user testing/feedback session go? What did you expect to learn? What did you actually learn?

We did not have any user testing/feedback sessions for this project. We did have to do some UX Audits which were interesting and definitely gave me a new perspective on UI and UX and the significance of doing research and going through user stories before starting a project.

#### What, if anything, have you learned about interacting with real clients on real projects?

I never had to personally be in contact with real clients. This project has taught me about things I should watch out for and things to do when communicating with people outside of my team.

#### Look back at your hopes and fears from the previous reflection. Have your hopes and fears changed? How? Why?
I'm just really hoping that our community partner will approve the work we've been doing since if they do not like what we've done then I have no clue what we're going to do with this project. I'm pretty excited to do a mini-project on the side though so that we can get some coding done.
