	•	How did the user testing/feedback session go? What did you expect to learn? What did you actually learn?
	⁃	I learned how to do UX Audits and constantly adjust the work that I am doing to fit the client’s wants. 

	•	What, if anything, have you learned about interacting with real clients on real projects?
	⁃	I learned that when interacting with real clients, there is always a lot of changes to what they may want. Clients may say that they want one thing but actually mean they want something else. There is often times when we keep changing our workflow because the client wants something else during the middle. There are a lot of unexpected adjustments 
  
	•	Look back at your hopes and fears from the previous reflection. Have your hopes and fears changed? How? Why?
	⁃	We have submitted another email for feedback on UX Audits so my hopes are that they will respond positively so that we can continue our work on other Audits. I am fearful because of the past concerns on the work we have submitted before.
