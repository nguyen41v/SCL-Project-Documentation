## 03/07/18 Vanessa's Reflection
* How did the user testing/feedback session go? What did you expect to learn? What did you actually learn?
    * We didn't do much with regards to user testing because we are mostly focused on "research" because that is what our community partner is requesting.
* What, if anything, have you learned about interacting with real clients on real projects?
    * People take awhile to respond.
* Look back at your hopes and fears from the previous reflection. Have your hopes and fears changed? How? Why?
    * My hopes and fears haven't changed. The situation hasn't changed much since last time.
