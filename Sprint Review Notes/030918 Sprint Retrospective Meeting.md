## 03/09/18 Sprint Retro Spective Meeting

**1.	What went well?**

Adjusting to new demands as a group. Learned how to do UX audits.

**2.	What didn't go well?**

Communication with the community partner could be better. It is still unclear what they want.

**3.	What have we learned (about working as a group)?**

Nothing new.

**4.	What should we do differently next time?**

Nothing new. We haven't done anything group intensive so it is not clear at the moment if there is anything we should do differently next time.

**5.	What have we yet to figure out (about team dynamics)?**

Since our project does not involve a lot of coding and we are doing use audits, we have yet to figure out how we do as a team when it comes to coding. Probably won't experience that much coding though.
