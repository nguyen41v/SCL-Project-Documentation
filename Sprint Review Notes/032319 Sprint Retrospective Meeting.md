## 03/23/18 Sprint Retro Spective Meeting

**1.	What went well?**

The community partner said that our work was on the right track this time.

**2.	What didn't go well?**

Nothing really.

**3.	What have we learned (about working as a group)?**

Learned more about how to do user experience audits.

**4.	What should we do differently next time?**

Nothing new.

**5.	What have we yet to figure out (about team dynamics)?**

Since our project does not involve a lot of coding and we are doing use audits, we have yet to figure out how we do as a team when it comes to coding. Probably won't experience that much coding though.
