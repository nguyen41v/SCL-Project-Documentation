**1.	What went well?**

Cleaning up the website. Implementing features.

Website loading/server issues. Communication with community partner.

**3.	What have we learned (about working as a group)?**

We learned more about delegating tasks.

**4.	What should we do differently next time?**

Remind each other of meeting times.

**5.	What have we yet to figure out (about team dynamics)?**

Since our project does not involve a lot of coding and we are doing use audits, we have yet to figure out how we do as a team when it comes to coding. Probably won't experience that much coding though.
