## 04/06/18 Sprint Retro Spective Meeting

**1.	What went well?**

We moved smoothly through the UX audits and successfully created a child theme.

**2.	What didn't go well?**

Need to figure out how to update child theme through FTP.

**3.	What have we learned (about working as a group)?**

Nothing new.

**4.	What should we do differently next time?**

Working on the website more because we finished the UX audits.

**5.	What have we yet to figure out (about team dynamics)?**

Since our project does not involve a lot of coding and we are doing use audits, we have yet to figure out how we do as a team when it comes to coding. Probably won't experience that much coding though.
