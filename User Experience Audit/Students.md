## Students User Experience Audit

#### User Story
###### Grad Student
Latina, mid-20s. At USC for her PhD, went to UCLA for her masters. Where she’s from, Pomona, is a strong part of her identity. Interested in mobility issues (for example, transportation patterns) for Black/Brown people, which relates to her personal family history. First got involved w/ Library as an intern 3 or so years ago. Has only recently started using Library for research but now is really excited about what’s here. Library “vibe” is important to her; very different from how she feels at other archives (intimidated, unimportant). Introduces others to the Library. Word of mouth a key way word gets spread about the Library. Involved with other groups, presents at conferences, likes to go on tours, to museums. Has a MySpace page.
